# Crispy_cone
Half and full angle of an injection cone.
Note- this file contains the python code to find the half angle of an injection cone.
steps to execute the code:
1. Open angles.py from the branch. Download the code into a local directory.
2. This code uses argument parsing to make it easier to change the src images.
3. The first commented line consists of the required command and arguments supplied to the program.
4. Change the path to your source image as required. (save the source image in the same directory as the code).
5. On the command line, first navigate to the code directory and then execute the command mentioned in steps 3 and 4.
6. Hit enter once command and arguments are entered.
7. Wait for code to run. Make sure all dependencies are installed before running this code. 
8. Execution time may depend on the hardware specs of the machine it is running on.
9. On successful execution of the code, you will see multiple images being displayed. 
10. The final result will be printed on the command terminal as well (as well as the full angle of the cone).
11. After execution of the code simply close all windows containing images to terminate the program.
